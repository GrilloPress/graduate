      <p class="lead">Following my graduate management scheme, I started at the Trust in 2000, as the then Operational Manager for A&amp;E and Endoscopy. </p>
      <p>The four hour A&amp;E standard was first implemented during my time which, as a relatively junior and fresh faced manager, very much put me under the spotlight.</p>
      <p>Since then I have also worked in Emergency Admissions, Older Peoples’ Services Cardiology and Cardiothoracic, Orthopaedics and Surgical Services.</p>
      <p>I still look back on my 5 years as General Manager (now known as Operations Director) for Surgical Services as one of my most favourite roles. I loved leading my own team and working closely with clinical colleagues to manage the day to day operational pressures of an extremely challenging service whilst trying to support with the tactical and strategic development of the service.</p>
      <p>I don’t think I have ever had a career plan but I probably have always wanted to be a Chief Operating Officer so when the opportunity presented at the Trust I was really excited.</p>
      <p>I genuinely feel very lucky to have had such a variety of challenging roles and to have been able to progress my career to date in a single, successful, organisation. I really enjoy working across the entire organisation and working with individuals I have worked with throughout my 16 years at the Trust.</p>
      <p>
The Trust is really focussed on developing good staff who are patient focussed and are willing to work hard to develop their leadership skills and behaviours. As a result, given its size and complexity as well as position within the City’s health and social care services and regional health provision, there are loads of opportunities for working with very talented and committed clinical and non-clinical staff. This creates a great, and supportive, environment to learn within and lots of opportunities to make a real difference to patients every day.</p>
